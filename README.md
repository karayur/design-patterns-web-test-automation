Design patterns, idioms, principles with web test automation examples in Python.

Inspired by [python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns) and [Design patterns in test automation (in Russian)](https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/338836/)

Some notes and disclaimers:
* This doc and code examples were created as a part of my Python test automation learning project. It reflects my personal experience which isn’t very significant (at least in Python).
* Examples based on pypi.org web UI created for illustration purpose only. It isn't supposed anybody use a similar approach for test automation design of pypi.org or any other site with similar components / structure.
* There is no such thing as a good design pattern or a bad design pattern. Each design pattern is created to address a specific problem or situation in development. If you don’t have such a problem do not use a pattern. Even though it is really cool.
* You might not need most of these patterns in end-to-end test automation. Even if you have a quite big system you better concentrate on unit and integration levels of [testing pyramid](url) (if it is possible). In this case the end-to-end test automation pack and framework is gonna be lightweight.
